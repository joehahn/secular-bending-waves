IDL code for simulating the spiral bending waves described in Hahn, 2007, ApJ, 665, 856.
That code was originally developed for a paper published in 2003. I myself no longer 
have IDL running at my fingertips...hopefully this still runs 16 years later on your 
more modern IDL install, fingers crossed.

To execute the simulation shown in Fig 4-6 of the 2007 paper, enter the outgoing_waves folder,
start IDL, and then

    %run ring_master.pro

to execute the simulation. Or so I think...its been a while.

And to execute the simulations seen in Figs 7-8, descend into the pan_in_out folder
and repeat the above. Good luck!
